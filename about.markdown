# Hi! I'm Elizabeth Purtell
What distinguishes me is a unique blend of skills and experiences. With a background steeped in creative arts and a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, I possess a discerning eye for aesthetics and an intimate understanding of design principles.

My aim is to craft visually stunning web designs, user-friendly applications, and more, with a particular focus on benefitting underserved communities, such as the queer, disabled, people-of-color, and autistic communities.

I'm enthusiastic about harnessing my skills and passion to make a positive impact, fully prepared to execute projects from concept to completion. I firmly believe that my journey from graphic design to software development has provided me with the ideal fusion of creativity and technical expertise to thrive in this dynamic field.What distinguishes me is a unique blend of skills and experiences.
